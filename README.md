# Introduction

Welcome to my overview of the data job market, with a focus on data analyst roles. I created this project to better understand and navigate the job market. It examines the highest-paying and most in-demand skills to help identify the best job opportunities for data analysts.


### Data
The data used comes from Luke Barousse's Python Course, which offers detailed insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills. Using Python scripts, I explore important questions such as the most sought-after skills, salary trends, and how demand and salary intersect in the field of data analytics.


# Key Questions Explored

Here are the questions my project aims to answer:

- What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 popular data roles?
- What are the trending in-demand skills for Data Analysts?
- How well do Data Analyst jobs and skills pay?
- What are the best skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand and High Pay)

# Tools Utilized

For my in-depth exploration of the data analyst job market, I used several essential tools:

- **Python**: The core tool for analyzing data and uncovering key insights.
- **Pandas Library**: For data analysis.
- **Matplotlib Library**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn Library**: For advanced data visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To run Python scripts, and easily include notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My main tool for executing Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control, sharing code, and ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

This section details the steps taken to prepare and clean the data for accurate and usable analysis.

## Data Import and Cleanup

I begin by importing the needed libraries and loading the dataset, then perform initial cleaning to ensure the data is of good quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns
import ast
from datasets import load_dataset


# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Focus on the Netherlands-Based Jobs

To concentrate on the Netherlands job market, I filter the dataset to include only roles based in the Netherlands.

```python
df_DA_NL = df[df['job_country'] == 'Netherlands']
```

# Analysis Overview

The Jupyter notebooks for this project were designed to explore different aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s the approach taken for each question:

## 1. What skills are most needed for the top 3 popular data roles?

To identify the most in-demand skills for the top 3 data roles, I first determined the most popular positions and then found the top 5 skills for each of these roles. This analysis reveals the key skills for the most popular job titles, helping to focus on the skills needed for each role.

Check out my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skills_Demand](3_Project/2_Skills_Demand.ipynb).

### Data Visualization

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:violet_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 70)

plt.show()
```

### Key Findings:

- **SQL** is the top requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Engineers, appearing in over half of the job postings for both roles. It is also requested for Data Scientist roles with 40%. 
- **Python** is the most sought-after skill for Data Scientists, found in 64% of their job postings.
- Data Engineers need more specialized technical skills (like AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists, who focus on general tools (such as Excel, Tableau).
- **Python** is in high demand across all three roles but is most critical for Data Scientists (64%) and Data Engineers (55%).

## 2. What are the trending skills for Data Analysts?

To track skill trends for Data Analysts in 2023, I filtered job postings by month and grouped the skills accordingly. This revealed the top 5 skills for each month, showing how their popularity changed throughout the year.

Check out my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Skills_Trend](3_Project/3_Skills_Trend.ipynb)

### Data Visualization

```python
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

df_plot = df_DA_NL_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend='full', palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.show()
```

## Results
![Trending Skills for Data Analyst in NL](3_Project/Images/Trending_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_NL.png)

_Bar chart showing the top trending skills for data analysts in the Netherlands for 2023._

### Key Findings

- **SQL** is the most consistently requested skill throughout the year but shows a gradual decline in demand.
- **Python** is in-demand skill requested following SQL.
- **Tableau** had stable demand with some fluctuations but remained crucial for data analysts.
- **Excel** also had a stable request throughoutr the year. 
- **Power BI** had saimilar demand as Tableau and Excel, but showed a slight upward trend towards the end of the year over Tableau.
- **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** had similar demand throughout the year, with only minor fluctuations. By year-end, all three had comparable demand for Data Analyst roles. 

## 3. How much do Data Analysts earn based on their skills?

To find the highest-paying roles and skills, I focused on jobs in the Netherlands and checked their median salaries. I first reviewed the salary distributions for common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst to see which ones offer the highest pay.

Check out my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](3_Project/4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Data Visualization

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_NL_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order, color='purple')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

### Results

![Distribution of Salaries for Data Jobs in NL](3_Project/Images/Distribution_of_Salaries_for_Data_Jobs_NL.png)

_Box plot showing the salary ranges for the top 6 data job titles._

### Key Findings

- **Salary ranges vary widely** across different job titles. Machine Learning Engineers have the highest salary potential, reaching up to $225K, reflecting the high value of advanced skills and experience.
  
- **Data Scientist** roles have high stable salary range, indicating that exceptional skills can lead to higher pay. 

- **Data Analyst** roles have more consistent salaries with very fewer high-end outliers.

- **Buisness Analyst** follows the satble range as well with no outliers. 

- **Data Engineer** roles have the most high-end outliers ranging till $175K. 

- **Median salaries rise** with seniority and specialization. Senior roles (like Data Scientist) not only offer higher median salaries but also show greater salary variation, reflecting increased responsibilities.

### Top-Paying and Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
Next, I focused solely on data analyst roles and examined both the highest-paid and most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to display these findings.

### Data Visualization

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:violet_r')
ax[0].legend().remove()

ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:violet')
ax[1].legend().remove()

ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.show()
```

### Results

![To Paying and In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts in NL](3_Project/Images/Top_Paying_and_In_Demand_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_NL.png)

_Bar charts showing the highest-paid and most in-demand skills for data analysts in the Netherlands._

### Key Findings

- The top graph shows that specialized technical skills in cloud technology like azure and aws lead to higher salaries, with some reaching up to $175K, indicating that advanced technical skills can boost earning potential.

- The bottom graph reveals that the BI tools like, Tableau, Go, and Looker pays high and the essential skills like Python, Excel, and SQL are the most in-demand as well, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This highlights the importance of these core skills for job opportunities in data analysis.

- There is a clear difference between the highest-paying skills and the most in-demand ones. Data analysts should aim to develop a mix of both high-paying specialized skills and widely sought-after foundational skills to maximize their career potential.

## 4. Which skill should Data Analysts learn to maximize demand and pay?

To find the best skills to learn (those that are both highly paid and in demand), I calculated the percentage of job postings requiring each skill and their median salaries. This helps to easily spot the most valuable skills to acquire.

Check out my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](3_Project/5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

### Data Visualization

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])

# Get current axes, set limits, and format axes
ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis

# Adjust text to avoid overlap and add arrows
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()
```

### Results

![Optimal Skills for Data Analyst in NL](3_Project/Images/Optimal_Skills_for_Data_Analysts_NL.png)
